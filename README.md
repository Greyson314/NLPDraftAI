# NLPDraftAI
Predict the draft position of prospects based on Natural Language Processing performed on Dane Brugler's "The Beast" Draft profile list. 


Update 4 June 2022: 
-Waiting to re-upload this repository to GitHub until I can expand the scope of the project beyond just the 2022 NFL draft. 


Results as of 5/25 update:

-Average error in predicted draft position: 21.3 spots

-Average error among top-100 prospects: 9.2 spots


List of AI's top-10 favorite prospect strengths/words of 5/25 update:

-Long 

-Wingspan

-Awareness

-Elite

-Consistently

-Outstanding

-Toolsy

-Heisman

-Rare

-Burst


TODO as of June 6:

-Separate inputs to learn differently from strengths/weaknesses/summary instead of just strengths

-Add data for all previous "Beasts" to massively increase dataset; 2022 is just a testing ground

-Separate by position

-Add different categories for testing/listed traits, e.g. "Arm Length = 8.5" instead of trying to use NLP to derive Arm Length
